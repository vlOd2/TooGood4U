# TooGood4U
A simple Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 hack client

# 💬 This repository
This repository contains NO SOURCE CODE and the client is available in obfuscated form only

# 💬 Why is the client packed (i.e contains all of the libraries and is also a launcher)
- This was done because in order to get ImGUI working, I had to make Minecraft use LWJGL 3, thanks to Lassebq again for their amazing LWJGL 3 wrapper (check bellow for more information)
- Also to reduce headache to users, and prevent people from using the client on regular launchers (which WILL NOT WORK)

# 📋 Features
- Kill Aura (hostile/passive mobs, players)
- Flight
- X-Ray (customize the blocks too!)
- NoClip
- Full Bright
- No Server Movement
- Timer (edit how many ticks occur per second)
- No Rain
- Instant Break (multi player too!)
- Invincibility (single player only)
- Jesus
- Fix RenderList (i.e fix rendering at high distances, i.e at the farlands)
- Disable world updates to improve performance at high distances (light, block, etc)
- ESP
- Changable camera FOV
- Use a Minecraft Classic (<=0.30) survival viewmodel
- Extended information on the player, the world and objects that are being looked at
